# Code Challenge 99

This repository contains multiple coding problems, each organized in its own folder (e.g., `problem-4`, `problem-5`, `problem-6`).

## How to Run Each Problem

For each problem, you will find a dedicated `README.md` file inside its folder. These files provide specific instructions on how to install dependencies, run, and test the code for that particular problem.

**Example:**
- To run or test code for `problem-4`, refer to `problem-4/README.md` for step-by-step guidance.

## General Structure
- Each problem folder contains its own solution and test files.
- Instructions are localized to each problem folder for clarity and ease of use.

If you have any questions, please check the corresponding `README.md` inside the problem folder first.
